# Fullstack example using TypeORM and TypeGraphQL


## Start backend

```
cd backend
yarn install
yarn start
```
## Start frontend

```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn serve

## Database
- There is no need to setup an extra database since we use an sqlite file here.

## What about graphql 16?
- Graphql 16 is not supported yet in Type-Graphql.
